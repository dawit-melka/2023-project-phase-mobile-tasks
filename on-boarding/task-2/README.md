# Task Manager Application

Create a simple command-line Task Manager application using Dart. This application allows users to manage tasks, including adding, viewing, editing, and deleting tasks. Each task has a title, description, due date, and status (completed or pending). The application uses object-oriented programming (OOP) principles to organize the code and manage task data efficiently.

- **Title:** The title of the task.
- **Description:** A detailed description of the task.
- **Due Date:** The date when the task is due.
- **Status:** The status of the task (completed or pending).

### Task Manager Class

The `TaskManager` class manages tasks and includes the following methods:

- **Add a New Task:** Add a new task with a title, description, due date, and initial status (pending).
- **View All Tasks:** Display a list of all tasks, including their title, due date, and status.
- **View Only Completed Tasks:** Display a list of tasks that are marked as completed.
- **View Only Pending Tasks:** Display a list of tasks that are pending and not yet completed.
- **Edit a Task:** Update the title, description, due date, or status of an existing task.
- **Delete a Task:** Remove a task from the task list.
