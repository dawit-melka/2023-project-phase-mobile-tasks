## Screens and Functionality
### Home Screen
The home screen displays a list of all tasks. Users can select a task to view its details and make updates.

### Add Task Screen
The "Add Task" screen allows users to input a new task's title and description. Upon submission, the task is added to the list on the home screen.

### Task Detail Screen
The "Edit Task" screen displays the details of a selected task. Users can update the task's title and description and save their changes.

## Running the App
1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/todo-mobile-app.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd todo-mobile-app
```
3. Ensure you have Flutter and Dart installed on your machine.

4. Run the app on an emulator or physical device:
```
flutter run
```
## Named Routes and Navigation
The app uses named routes for navigation between screens. This approach provides a cleaner and more organized way to handle routing within the app.

### Example of Using Named Routes:
```
Navigator.pushNamed(context, '/add-task');
```
### Passing Data Between Screens
When adding or editing a task, the user's input is passed between screens using the navigation arguments feature. This ensures that the task data is displayed accurately and consistently throughout the app.

## Navigation Animations
Smooth navigation animations and transitions have been implemented to enhance the user experience. Transitions between screens provide a visually appealing and intuitive flow.

## Handling Navigation Events
The app handles navigation events, such as pressing the back button, to ensure a consistent navigation flow. When the user presses the back button from the add/edit task screen, the app navigates back to the home screen.
