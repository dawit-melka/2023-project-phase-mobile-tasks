## Circular Counter Logic
The Circular Counter App features a unique counter logic that ensures the counter value remains within a circular range of 0 to 10. This innovative approach adds a delightful touch to the user experience and eliminates any concerns about exceeding the limit.

## How It Works
When the user interacts with the "Increment" button and the counter reaches the value of 10, the app employs circular logic to reset the counter back to 0. This creates a seamless loop, giving the impression that the counter is in constant motion, moving from 0 to 10 and back to 0.

Conversely, if the counter is at 0 and the user interacts with the "Decrement" button, the circular logic comes into play once again. The counter resets from 0 to 10, creating a smooth transition as the counter continues its circular journey.
